# Seth's Dotfiles

Here lies a collection of configurations.

## Installation

`git clone git@github.com:four43/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles && ./install`

Managed by dotbot.

## Showing Off

Fun utilities to show off customizations

  * neofetch - Outputs distro as ascii art, system information and color pallette
  * gtop - System load history as cli charts. Uses node.js though :(
