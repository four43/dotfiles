# i3 Window Manager

i3 (gaps) is a simple tiling window manager designed for maximum efficiency and customization. Scripts power everything allowing nearly everything to be customized to your liking. Everything is very keyboard oriented, taking queues from `vim`. Consistent, customizable.

## Terms

i3 is "lots of assembly requires", it's very bare bones when we start, so we'll use a few pieces to pull things together.

 * [i3-gaps](https://github.com/Airblader/i3) - Window Manager, replaces Gnome3, KDE, etc. We use the "gaps" version that has some more features.
 * [polybar](https://github.com/jaagr/polybar) - A "bar" for display of time, system information, really anything. Very customizable.
 * [rofi](https://github.com/DaveDavenport/rofi) - Menu/launcher - A smart menu that's ready to launch apps and search with a few keystrokes.
 * [urxvt (rxvt-unicode)](http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/rxvt-unicode.html)[^1](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Rxvt-unicode) - Terminal - Very customizable minimal fully featured terminal
 * [Ranger](https://github.com/ranger/ranger) - CLI File Manager - A vim inspired file browser
 * [nerdfonts](https://nerdfonts.com/) - Collection of fonts with useful icons baked in. DroidSansMono looks pretty cool.
 * [betterlockscreen](https://github.com/pavanjadhaw/betterlockscreen) - Lock Screen - A quick blurred lock screen script.
