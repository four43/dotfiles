# Docker CLI Extensions/Plugins

You can make little docker extension scripts and execute them by running `docker [extname]`, they even show up in `docker --help`!

* The best instructions are here: https://gist.github.com/thaJeztah/340fe943e5f0426407eec32e22809ec4
* Docker GitHub Issue: https://github.com/docker/cli/issues/1534

Basically put scripts in `~/.docker/cli-plugins`, they need to be executable.
